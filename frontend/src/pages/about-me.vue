                                I earned a BA in Psychology and Elementary Education from California State University 
                                Long Beach in 1987. I worked as a classroom teacher in Torrance, CA 1993-1999 
                                where I was chosen to be a district mentor teacher. During this time I facilitated 
                                teacher training, and worked as a teaching coach for district teachers. I was 
                                trained in Reading Recovery and worked with at-risk 1st grade students teaching 
                                this program. Between 2000-2008 I ran a successful tutoring business in PA while 
                                raising my young children. After moving to Colorado Springs in 2009, I worked as 
                                a classroom teacher for Fountain Fort Carson School District 8 until 2020. In 2018, 
                                I was trained in Orton Gillingham multi-sensory reading program through IMSE. 
                                I began using the Heggerty Phonemic Awareness Program in 2019 with my second 
                                grade students. In 2021, I began training in dyslexia therapy through the Colorado 
                                Literacy and Learning Center. I am a student member of ALTA professional organization. 
                                When I am not tutoring, I enjoy spending time with my family, kayaking, walking 
                                my dogs, and making delicious meals.
